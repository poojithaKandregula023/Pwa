What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. PWAs combine the best of web and mobile apps, working across all platforms from a single codebase while providing features traditionally available only to native applications.

 Key Characteristics of PWAs

1. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice
   - Provide basic functionality even on older browsers
   - Deliver enhanced experiences on modern browsers
 2. **Responsive Design**
   - Adapt to any screen size (desktop, mobile, tablet)
   - Fit any form factor (including future devices)

3. **Connectivity Independent**
   - Service Workers enable offline functionality
   - Cache important assets for offline use
   - Sync data when connection is restored

4. **App-like Experience**
   - Feel like native apps with smooth interactions
   - Run in full-screen mode (when installed)
   - Support for app gestures and navigation patterns

 5. **Fresh Content**
   - Always up-to-date thanks to service worker updates
   - Background content synchronization

6. **Safe**
   - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping
   - Ensure content hasn't been tampered with
 7. **Discoverable**
   - Identifiable as "applications" thanks to W3C manifests
   - Indexable by search engines (unlike native apps)

8. **Re-engageable**
   - Push notifications to keep users engaged
   - Home screen icons for easy access

9. **Installable**
   - Can be added to home screen without app store
   - Launch in full-screen mode when opened this way

10. **Linkable**
   - Easily shared via URL
   - No complex installation required

 Core Technologies Behind PWAs

1. **Service Workers**
   - JavaScript files that run separately from the main browser thread
   - Handle network requests programmatically
   - Enable offline functionality and background sync
   - Manage caching strategies
 2. **Web App Manifest**
   - JSON file that describes the application
   - Defines how the app appears to users
   - Specifies home screen icons, splash screen, colors, etc.

 3. **Application Shell Architecture**
   - Minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed for UI
   - Loads instantly from cache
   - Content loads dynamically

4. **HTTPS**
   - Required for service workers and many PWA features
   - Ensures security and data integrity
